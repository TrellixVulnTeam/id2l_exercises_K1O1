    "In this notebook we will explore datasets in which the features are not images, but CSV files with different features, either numeric or categorical. More specifically, we will look at the housing dataset, famous for being used as an introduction to regression problems, which are problems in which we try to predict a continous variable (eg: the price of a house), rather than a discrete one (eg: the label of an image). \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges of working with such a dataset are different from the ones we encounter when working with image data. Because each feature is basically the answer to one question (eg: 'Where is the house?', 'Does it have a pool?', 'What surface does the house have?' etc), some of the features might be missing or might have invalid values.\n",

Even though the housing prices dataset is small enough to fit in memory and apply the tranform at once on the whol dataframe, in other situations we might have to deal with much bigger datasets, so it is good practice to implement transforms that are applied on individual rows of the dataframe, especially as this is also the way in which the standard PyTorch transforms are applied.\n",
